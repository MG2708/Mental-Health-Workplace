# Mental-Health-Workplace
The IBM SkillsBuild Project Based Internship with AICTE has resulted in the development of a straightforward 
web application that can predict an individual's mental health condition based on a simple form. 
The form comprises questions that revolve around the atmosphere of your workplace.  
With the help of this application, users can gain insights into their mental health status. 

The model uses two algorithms: Random Forest Classifier and K-Nearest Neighbors Classifier.
It also uses various Python libraries for data preprocessing, analysis, and modeling. The libraries used in the code include:
* NumPy: for numerical computations and array manipulation
* Pandas: for data manipulation and analysis
* Matplotlib: for data visualization and plotting
* Seaborn: for data visualization and plotting
* scikit-learn: for data preprocessing and modeling
* LabelEncoder: for encoding categorical data
* MinMaxScaler: for scaling numerical data
